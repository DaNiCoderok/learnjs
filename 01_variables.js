// we will learn about variables in js in this file

// there are 3 types of variables

// here are some examples

// first is  >> var << variable
// example is 
var name = 'Dani'
console.log(name);
/*
Defination: var is old type of variable to store the data but there were lots of issue with var keywords.
so it got changed. everyone now recommended to use let to issue value.
*/


// second is  >> let << variable
// example is 
let myName = 'Daniname'
console.log(myName);
/*
Defination: let is the new type of javascript variable in which you can take any value and store it . it can be change.
if someone change the value in the project then it will be changed.
 */


// third is  >> const << variable
// example
const myDob = 1990
console.log(myDob);
/*
Defination: const keyword meaning constant its mean it will never change throughout the project. even if someone want to change
it cannot be changed. its not possible to change the value inside the const variable
